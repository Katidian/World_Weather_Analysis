# World Weather Analysis

This project uses numpy to select hundreds of random latitude/longitude pairs and uses citypy to identify the closest city to each set of coordinates. It then 
gets current weather data for each city from OpenWeather's API. 

Users input their preferred temperature range for a vacation destination. The script then uses the weather data and the Google Maps API to create maps of possible 
vacation destinations and itineraries based on those weather criteria.
